## ðŸš€ Why Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)?

### âœ… 1. Real Performance Benefits
- **Native Performance**: Uses platform-specific implementations where it matters
- **Small Binary Size**: Only shared code is compiled for both platforms
- **Direct Platform Access**: Can still use native APIs when needed

### âš¡ 2. Development Efficiency
- **Single Codebase**: Write business logic once, use everywhere
- **Faster Development**: Changes in shared code automatically apply to both platforms
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same business logic means same behavior across platforms

### ðŸŽ¨ 3. UI Development
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Platform-Specific UI**: Can use native UI components when needed
- **Shared Components**: Reuse UI logic across platforms

### ðŸ”§ 4. Easy Integration
- **Gradle Setup**: Familiar build system
- **CocoaPods**: Standard iOS dependency management
- **Platform-Specific Code**: Can still write native code when needed

### ðŸ”„ 5. Maintenance Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: Business logic in one place
- **Easier Testing**: Shared code means shared tests
- **Consistent Updates**: Update once, deploy everywhere

### ðŸ’° 6. Real Cost Benefits
- **Reduced Development Time**: Write once, run everywhere
- **Smaller Team Size**: One team can handle both platforms
- **Faster Time to Market**: Develop features once for both platforms

### ðŸ“˜ 7. Learning Curve
- **Kotlin**: Similar to Swift/Java
- **Compose**: Similar to SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: Similar to native patterns

## âœ… Real-World Proof

- **Production Ready**: Used in real applications
- **Scalable**: Can grow with your needs
- **Community Support**: Active development and support

> This project shows that **KMP isn't just a theoretical solution** â€“ it's a **practical approach** that can save time and resources while maintaining the **quality and performance** native developers expect.



## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Platform-Specific Code**
  - Uses `expect`/`actual` declarations for platform-specific implementations
  - Example: `MapViewComponent` has different implementations for Android and iOS

- **Clean Architecture**
  - **Domain layer**: Business logic and models
  - **Data layer**: Network and local storage
  - **Presentation layer**: UI components and screens

- **Dependency Injection**
  - Uses **Koin** for managing dependencies
  - Separate modules for different features

- **Real Implementation Details**
  - **Network Layer**: Ktor client with platform-specific engines
  - **UI Components**: Shared Compose components with platform-specific adaptations





* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
