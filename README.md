## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Platform-Specific Code**
  - Uses `expect`/`actual` declarations for platform-specific implementations
  - Example: `MapViewComponent` has different implementations for Android and iOS

- **Clean Architecture**
  - **Domain layer**: Business logic and models
  - **Data layer**: Network and local storage
  - **Presentation layer**: UI components and screens

- **Dependency Injection**
  - Uses **Koin** for managing dependencies
  - Separate modules for different features

- **Real Implementation Details**
  - **Network Layer**: Ktor client with platform-specific engines
  - **UI Components**: Shared Compose components with platform-specific adaptations





* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
